"""
The live-viz bridge state: what a running demo publishes to the viewer.

This module is free of HTTP and of hook installation — it holds the :class:`Bridge`
singleton whose snapshot methods run on the *simulation* thread (see
:mod:`cram_viz.live.hooks` for why that matters) and whose ``get_*`` accessors hand
finished, plain-dict snapshots to the HTTP layer.

Node status is where the plan and the statechart differ: coraplex only performs the plan
root (``Plan.perform`` → ``root.perform``); ``ActionNode.notify`` expands its children
but never performs them, so every inner ``PlanNode`` keeps status ``CREATED`` for the
whole run. The real per-step progress lives in the giskardpy motion statechart's life
cycle. ``GiskardExecutable.motion_mappings`` (a ``{MotionNode: Task}`` dict) is the
bridge between the two — the life cycle of each motion node's task is read and
propagated up the plan tree; those statuses are flagged ``derived``.
