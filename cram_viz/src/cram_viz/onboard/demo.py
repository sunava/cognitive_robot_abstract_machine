"""
Turn a coraplex demo into a self-contained web-viewer scene.

Runs the demo file *unmodified* under instrumentation and emits a scene bundle
into :func:`cram_viz.paths.scenes_dir`::

    <scenes dir>/<name>/
        scene.json         models, robot parts, objects, segments, targets
        trajectory.json    per-tick joints + robot base + object world poses
        <model>.urdf       package:// resolved & rewritten
        meshes/...         all meshes + textures the scene needs

What the hooks capture while the demo runs:
  - every package:// asset resolution and every URDF/STL the world loads
  - per-tick positions of all movable connections (giskardpy Executor.tick)
  - world pose of the robot base and of every loose object (STL mesh or spawned box)
  - one segment per executed plan ActionNode, with nesting depth
  - the robot's semantic annotation: base body, arms, end-effector link sets

Usage (the interpreter needs the CRAM stack on it)::

    cram-viz-onboard path/to/demo.py --name pr2_kitchen
