# Personal Claude Code notes hook

An opt-in `SessionStart` hook that populates `CLAUDE.local.md` — which Claude Code already loads
automatically as project memory, and which is gitignored — from a personal branch you name for
yourself on a remote (`origin` by default), so your own workflow preferences ("always open my PRs
as drafts," "never touch branch X directly," etc.) persist across sessions without ever being
committed to a shared branch.

It works out of the box with no config at all: it reads from a branch named `claude/personal-notes`
on `origin` unless you tell it otherwise. Run [`create-personal-notes-branch.sh`](./create-personal-notes-branch.sh)
once to create that branch with an empty notes file, and every session from then on picks it up
automatically. It is collision-free for multiple contributors sharing one remote if you each
override the branch name via your own config instead of relying on the shared default.

## How it decides what to read

`session-start.sh` looks for a remote in this order, first one found wins:

1. **`git config claude.personalNotesRemote`** — local to one clone's `.git/config`.
2. **`CLAUDE_PERSONAL_NOTES_REMOTE` environment variable** — used only if the git config isn't set.
3. **`origin`** — the zero-config default, used if neither of the above is set.

The branch name on that remote follows the same precedence (`claude.personalNotesBranch` git
config, then `CLAUDE_PERSONAL_NOTES_BRANCH` env var, then the default `claude/personal-notes`), and
so does the path on that branch (`claude.personalNotesPath` git config, then
`CLAUDE_PERSONAL_NOTES_PATH` env var, then the default `.claude/personal/cram-notes.md`).

The hook is still a no-op in effect for anyone who never creates the branch it resolves to: `git
fetch` finds nothing, so it exits without writing `CLAUDE.local.md`.

### When you need to override the remote

The remote only needs overriding when your own notes don't live on this clone's `origin` — for
example, some session environments name the upstream repo `origin` and give your own fork a
different remote name, or don't add your fork as a remote at all. The value can be either form,
and `git fetch`/`git push` accept both identically:

- **A remote name already configured in the clone** (e.g. `myfork`) — the natural choice for a
  persistent local clone where you've already added your fork as a remote.
- **A raw git URL** (e.g. `https://github.com/<you>/<repo>`) — needs no `git remote add` first, so
  it works even in a clone that's never heard of your fork (a session environment that only added
  the upstream repo, or a fresh clone every session). This is usually the right choice for
  overriding the remote specifically, since it has no dependency on a particular remote alias
  existing.

Whether you need to override the default branch name depends on how your sessions start:

- **A persistent local clone** (you `git clone` once and keep working in it) → the default just
  works once you've run the setup script below. Only set git config if you want a different
  branch/path than the shared default (e.g. to keep your notes separate from other contributors').
- **A fresh clone every session** (e.g. a cloud/web session environment that clones the repo from
  scratch each time) → the default still just works, since it needs no `.git/config` entry to
  survive. Only set the environment variable if you want to override it — see Option A below.

## Setup: quick start (works for both persistent and fresh-clone sessions)

Once, from any clone with push access to `origin`:

```bash
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/create-personal-notes-branch.sh"
```

This creates `claude/personal-notes` on `origin` with a single empty
`.claude/personal/cram-notes.md`, without touching your current branch or working tree. Every new
Claude Code session — local or fresh-clone — now runs the hook automatically and writes
`CLAUDE.local.md` from that branch, with no further configuration needed.

## Editing your notes

Just ask Claude, in any session: *"add \<X\> to my personal notes"* or *"edit my personal notes."*
No extra setup or explanation is needed — `session-start.sh` writes a short header at the top of
`CLAUDE.local.md` every session (see below), and since Claude Code already loads `CLAUDE.local.md`
as project memory, that header is always in context. It names the resolved branch/path and points
at [`save-personal-notes.sh`](./save-personal-notes.sh), so Claude edits the notes below the header
and runs that script to push the change back — deterministically, with no guessing at where notes
live or how to persist them.

The header looks like this (regenerated every session — editing it has no effect):

```
<!--
Personal notes, synced from 'claude/personal-notes' (.claude/personal/cram-notes.md) by session-start.sh.
To edit: change the notes below this line, then run
  "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/save-personal-notes.sh"
to push the change back to 'claude/personal-notes'. This header is regenerated
every session from git config/environment/default - editing it has no effect.
-->
<!-- END-PERSONAL-NOTES-HEADER -->
```

To do it by hand instead: edit `CLAUDE.local.md` below that marker line, then run

```bash
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/save-personal-notes.sh"
```

It resolves the branch/path exactly like `session-start.sh` does, strips the header back out, and
pushes only your actual notes content — in a scratch worktree, so your current branch and working
tree are untouched, and as a no-op if nothing actually changed.

## Setup: overriding the default remote/branch/path

Skip this section if the zero-config default above is all you need. The three settings are
independent — override only the one(s) you actually need (e.g. just the remote, if your fork isn't
this clone's `origin` but the default branch/path are fine).

### Persistent local clone

Once per clone, never committed:

```bash
git config claude.personalNotesRemote <remote-name-or-url>   # optional, defaults to origin
git config claude.personalNotesBranch <your-branch-name>
git config claude.personalNotesPath   <path-on-that-branch>   # optional, defaults to
                                                                 # .claude/personal/cram-notes.md
```

Push your notes file to that branch on that remote (any branch name, any path — it never merges
anywhere), e.g. by running the branch-creation script with overrides:

```bash
CLAUDE_PERSONAL_NOTES_REMOTE=<remote-name-or-url> \
  CLAUDE_PERSONAL_NOTES_BRANCH=<your-branch-name> CLAUDE_PERSONAL_NOTES_PATH=<path-on-that-branch> \
  "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/create-personal-notes-branch.sh"
```

### Cloud/web sessions (fresh clone every time)

Push your notes file exactly as above first. Then wire the environment variables into your session
environment's configuration — which of the two options below applies depends on what your specific
environment offers:

### Option A: your environment has a persistent environment-variable list

Copy [`personal-notes.env.example`](./personal-notes.env.example) into that list, with your own
values substituted:

```
CLAUDE_PERSONAL_NOTES_REMOTE=<remote-name-or-url>
CLAUDE_PERSONAL_NOTES_BRANCH=<your-branch-name>
CLAUDE_PERSONAL_NOTES_PATH=<path-on-that-branch>
```

`session-start.sh` reads these directly — nothing else to configure.

### Option B: your environment has a "setup script" (arbitrary commands run on every fresh clone)

Set the same variables however that setup script can see them (its own env-var mechanism, or
literal `export` lines above the call), then run
[`configure-personal-notes.sh`](./configure-personal-notes.sh), e.g.:

```bash
export CLAUDE_PERSONAL_NOTES_REMOTE=<remote-name-or-url>   # optional
export CLAUDE_PERSONAL_NOTES_BRANCH=<your-branch-name>
export CLAUDE_PERSONAL_NOTES_PATH=<path-on-that-branch>   # optional
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/configure-personal-notes.sh"
```

This seeds the fresh clone's git config from those variables, so `session-start.sh` finds them
exactly as it would for a persistent local clone. It's a no-op if none of the three are set, so
it's safe to include even before you've opted in.

See your environment provider's docs for exactly where to paste a setup script or persistent
environment variables (for Claude Code on the web: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web>).

## Verifying it worked

Start a fresh session and check whether `CLAUDE.local.md` exists at the project root with your
notes content. To check the mechanics without waiting for a real session boot, run the hook
directly:

```bash
"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh" && cat CLAUDE.local.md
```

## Safety

- No-op in effect for anyone who never creates the `claude/personal-notes` branch (or an override
  target): `git fetch` finds nothing, so nothing gets written.
- Never merges anything: the hook only ever *reads* the resolved branch, off `FETCH_HEAD` via `git
  show` (not a `<remote>/<branch>` ref, since a URL-form remote creates no tracking ref for one). It
  never checks the branch out or merges it into your working branch.
- `create-personal-notes-branch.sh` and `save-personal-notes.sh` never touch your current branch or
  working tree either — both do their work in a scratch worktree.
  `create-personal-notes-branch.sh` refuses to run if the target branch already exists locally or
  on the resolved remote; `save-personal-notes.sh` is a no-op if there's nothing new to push.
- The sync header `session-start.sh` writes is never itself pushed back: `save-personal-notes.sh`
  strips everything up to and including the `END-PERSONAL-NOTES-HEADER` marker before committing,
  so only your actual notes content ever lands on the notes branch.
- `CLAUDE.local.md` is gitignored, so populated notes can't accidentally end up in a commit on any
  branch, including this one.
- Safe to re-run: `session-start.sh` only ever overwrites `CLAUDE.local.md`, and does nothing if
  the resolved branch or path isn't reachable (e.g. a fresh clone, or a fork that never created
  it).
- Coexists with your own hooks: Claude Code merges `SessionStart` hook arrays across all settings
  layers by concatenation, not override, so this hook runs alongside — never instead of — any
  `SessionStart` hook you already have configured for yourself.
