# The wording of session-start.sh's summary lines, defined once.
#
# Sourced by ./session-start.sh, which prints these, and called directly by the
# tests that assert on them - so a reworded message changes both sides at once
# instead of drifting apart from a second copy typed into an assertion.
#
# One function per outcome rather than one template string per outcome: the
# arguments are then named and positional in the same place the sentence is
# written, and a caller that passes the wrong number fails loudly here rather
# than rendering a half-substituted line.
#
# Deliberately holds no logic. Deciding *which* message applies is
# session-start.sh's business; this file only says how each one reads.
