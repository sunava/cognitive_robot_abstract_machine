# Persists edits made to CLAUDE.local.md back onto the personal-notes branch
# on its remote (default: `origin`), so the next session's session-start.sh
# reads the updated notes. This is the write half of the loop
# session-start.sh's own header (see ./session-start.sh) points Claude at when
# asked to edit your notes: edit CLAUDE.local.md below its header, then run
# this script.
#
# Usage (from the project root, after editing CLAUDE.local.md):
#   "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/save-personal-notes.sh"
#
# Resolves the remote/branch/path exactly like session-start.sh (git config >
# environment variable > the zero-config default), so it always writes back
# to wherever the notes were read from. The remote may be a configured
# remote's name or a raw git URL - see ./README.md.
#
# Strips the auto-generated sync header (everything up to and including the
# "END-PERSONAL-NOTES-HEADER" marker line) before pushing, so the header
# itself never ends up committed to the notes branch - only your actual notes
# content does.
#
# Safe to re-run: a no-op if CLAUDE.local.md's content (after stripping the
# header) already matches what's on the branch. Does its work in a scratch
# worktree, so it never touches your current branch or working tree. Fails
# with a clear message if the target branch doesn't exist yet on the remote -
# run ./create-personal-notes-branch.sh first in that case.
