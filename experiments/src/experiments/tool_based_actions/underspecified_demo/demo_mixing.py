Underspecified mixing demo: a PR2 mixes the contents of a bowl on the apartment kitchen
counter with a whisk mounted on its right gripper.

Unlike the simple demo, no concrete values are given for the base pose or the mixing
duration: both are left as ellipses and sampled from the probabilistic backend, bounded
only by where-conditions.
