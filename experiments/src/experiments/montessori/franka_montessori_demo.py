"""
Build the Montessori shape-sorting world and have a table-mounted Franka Emika Panda
sort every loose shape into its matching hole -- the same narrative as
:mod:`experiments.montessori.montessori_demo`'s HSRB-driven original, but reaching with
its arm alone (see
:meth:`~experiments.montessori.world.MontessoriWorld.mount_stationary_robot`; the Panda
has no mobile base to navigate) and holding each shape by the gripper's own contact
friction throughout the whole run, rather than kinematically teleporting it and settling
it afterwards (see :mod:`experiments.montessori.franka_panda_equipment`).

Run with (the ``experiments`` package must be importable)::

    python -m experiments.montessori.franka_montessori_demo
    python -m experiments.montessori.franka_montessori_demo --viewer
    python -m experiments.montessori.franka_montessori_demo --iterations 100

Every run's per-shape results are recorded, one :class:`~experiments.montessori.sorting_results.SortingIterationResult` (with
its :class:`~experiments.montessori.sorting_results.ShapeInsertionResult` rows) per iteration, to a local SQLite database via
ORMatic; see ``--database-uri`` and :data:`DEFAULT_DATABASE_URI`.

.. note::
    :class:`~experiments.montessori.sorting_results.ShapeInsertionResult` and :class:`~experiments.montessori.sorting_results.SortingIterationResult` must be included
    in ``experiments.orm.ormatic_interface`` before a run can persist anything;
    regenerate it with ``python scripts/regenerate_all_orm.py`` (from the repository
    root, in an environment with ROS 2 installed) if they are not already there.
