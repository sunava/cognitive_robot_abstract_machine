Moving a robot's hand from the viewer while no plan moves the robot.

A driver thread servos each commanded arm's tool frame towards its target: every tick it
moves the target a bounded step from where the tool is, solves the inverse kinematics of
that near pose and writes the joint values. A target the arm cannot reach leaves the arm
where it is for that tick.
