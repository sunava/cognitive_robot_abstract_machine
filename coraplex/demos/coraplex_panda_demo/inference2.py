"""
Second-generation copy of ``inference.py``, closed-loop stacking with JPT-guided sampling
and causal failure diagnosis against the models ``training/train_jpt2.py`` fits.

Structured exactly like ``inference.py`` -- same world, simulation, segmind setup and
diagnose-and-correct loop -- with two differences:

- The arm parks between the pickup and the place on every attempt, including every
  corrective retry, instead of crossing directly from the pickup pose to the place pose.
  ``inference.py`` itself notes why that park matters (its own comment on
  ``build_stack_plan``: once the stack has some height, the direct crossing can pass
  right through where the already-stacked cubes are) but currently has it disabled; a
  corrective retry repeats that same crossing several times in a row, which is exactly
  where a collision with an already-stacked cube is most likely. ``demo3.py`` collects
  its training data with this same park in place, so the diagnoser here is trained on
  attempts shaped like the ones it corrects.
- Diagnosis is done against ``causal_diagnosis_v2``'s trees, whose causal circuit uses
  ``object_final_z`` -- the height the picked cube actually settled at -- as the effect
  variable instead of ``step_index``. See ``causal_diagnosis_v2.py``'s own docstring for
  why that makes ``object_friction`` a candidate cause on the same footing as every other
  tunable parameter, with nothing spent on a structural role that carries no information
  about success.
