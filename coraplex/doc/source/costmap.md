# Costmaps

Costmaps are way to describe positions in a defined area around a pose with respect to certain constrains. For example,
there is a costmap which contains every position from which a certain object is visible.

In CoraPlex these costmaps are used to dynamically generate poses for certain criteria like visibility, reachability
or occupancy. So if you, for example, want to find a position from where the robot can see a certain object you would
generate a costmap for the visibility and one for occupancy. These costmaps can then be merged with one another and
result in a costmap which contains every position from which the object is visible and where the robot can stand.

All costmaps live in {mod}`coraplex.locations.costmaps` and are dataclasses, so their parameters are best given as
keyword arguments. Every costmap needs the {class}`~semantic_digital_twin.world.World` it is built for. Currently there
are four types of costmaps implemented:

* Occupancy Costmap
* Visibility Costmap
* Gaussian Costmap
* Ring Costmap

## Occupancy Costmap

Occupancy costmaps represent all positions that don't have any objects positioned above them. Meaning the robot can
stand there without colliding with anything. The map is generated directly from the semantic digital twin world by
casting rays around the origin. A user can additionally specify a value by which obstacles should be inflated, creating
a boundary around obstacles to avoid colliding with them.

```python
from coraplex.locations.costmaps import OccupancyCostmap
from semantic_digital_twin.spatial_types.spatial_types import Pose

occupancy = OccupancyCostmap(
    resolution=0.02,
    width=200,
    height=200,
    origin=Pose.from_xyz_rpy(1, 0.3, 0, reference_frame=world.root),
    world=world,
    robot_view=robot,
    distance_to_obstacle=0.2,
)
```

See {class}`~coraplex.locations.costmaps.OccupancyCostmap` for the full parameter reference.

For the common case of a costmap centered on a target pose with the inflation radius derived from the robot base, there
is the convenience classmethod {meth}`~coraplex.locations.costmaps.OccupancyCostmap.default_map`.

```python
occupancy = OccupancyCostmap.default_map(context, target_pose)
```

You can see an image of the final Occupancy costmap with an inflation radius of 0.2 m below.

## Visibility Costmap

Visibility costmaps show the visibility for a specific position in a restricted area. This means every position from
which the robot can see the position given as the map origin.

The visibility costmap is created by taking depth images from the origin
position of the costmap and then checking which positions are occluded by other objects. Essentially, this specifies
how far you can look from the object in all direction. Afterwards, a 2D representation is created from these depth images.

```python
from coraplex.locations.costmaps import VisibilityCostmap
from semantic_digital_twin.spatial_types.spatial_types import Pose

visibility = VisibilityCostmap(
    min_height=1.27,
    max_height=1.6,
    resolution=0.02,
    width=200,
    height=200,
    origin=Pose.from_xyz_rpy(1, 0.3, 0, reference_frame=world.root),
    world=world,
)
```

See {class}`~coraplex.locations.costmaps.VisibilityCostmap` for the full parameter reference.

A simple visibility costmap with two objects can be seen below.

## Gaussian Costmap

A gaussian costmap is essentially a 2D gauss distribution with its peak at the centre of the the costmap. Gaussian
costmaps are, for example, used to approximate reachability of objects. The idea being that to reach an object the
robot has to be relatively close to the object to reach it.

Since all other objects use just 0 or 1 to represent if an entry in the costmap is valid according to their respective
constraint Gaussian Costmaps add some variance to highlight a certain point. This is especially useful when keeping in
mind that sampling from the costmap is based on the maximum likelihood, meaning the cells with the highest value will be
sampled first.

```python
from coraplex.locations.costmaps import GaussianCostmap
from semantic_digital_twin.spatial_types.spatial_types import Pose

gauss = GaussianCostmap(
    mean=200,
    sigma=15,
    resolution=0.02,
    origin=Pose.from_xyz_rpy(1, 0.3, 0, reference_frame=world.root),
    world=world,
)
```

See {class}`~coraplex.locations.costmaps.GaussianCostmap` for the full parameter reference.

A plot of the gaussian costmap can be seen below. This is a matplotlib plot of the costmap to better show the
distribution.

## Ring Costmap

A ring costmap is similar to the gaussian costmap but looks more like a donut: the high-probability area forms a ring
at a configurable distance from the center. This is useful to create poses for reaching a point, where standing exactly
on top of the target is not desirable.

```python
from coraplex.locations.costmaps import RingCostmap
from semantic_digital_twin.spatial_types.spatial_types import Pose

ring = RingCostmap(
    std=15,
    distance=0.7,
    resolution=0.02,
    width=200,
    height=200,
    origin=Pose.from_xyz_rpy(1, 0.3, 0, reference_frame=world.root),
    world=world,
)
```

See {class}`~coraplex.locations.costmaps.RingCostmap` for the full parameter reference.

## Visualization of Costmaps

For a comprehensive visualization of a costmap there is the {func}`~coraplex.locations.costmaps.plot_grid` function in
`costmaps.py`. It creates a matplotlib plot of the 2D numpy array which represents the costmap and can be called as
follows:

```python
from coraplex.locations.costmaps import plot_grid

plot_grid(visibility.map)
```

The image for the gaussian costmap shows such a matplotlib plot.

## Merging Costmaps

It is possible to merge different costmaps to create a costmap that contains positions that adhere to more than one
constraint. For example, if you merge a visibility and occupancy costmap you get a costmap that contains positions
where the robot can stand and see a specific point. Costmaps support the `+` operator (additive merge) and the `&`
operator.

```python
reachability_map = occupancy + gauss
visible_and_free = occupancy & visibility
```

To be able to merge different costmaps there are a few restrictions that you have to follow. The restrictions are:

* The costmaps must have the same size
* The costmaps must have the same origin
* The costmaps must have the same resolution
* The costmaps must belong to the same world

These restrictions make it much easier to merge costmaps and also reduce the probability of errors occurring in the
resulting costmap. Since for all costmaps these parameter can be set when creating them, it shouldn't pose a
problem to match these parameter for all created costmaps, making them able to be merged.
