# External Interfaces

External interfaces connect CoraPlex to services that live outside of the belief state, such as perception pipelines or
third-party hardware APIs. They live in {mod}`coraplex.external_interfaces`.

## RoboKudo

{mod}`coraplex.external_interfaces.robokudo` is the interface to the [RoboKudo](https://robokudo.ai.uni-bremen.de/)
perception framework. It sends queries over a ROS action interface and returns the detected objects, for example via
`query_object` for a specific object description, `query_all_objects` to detect everything in view, or
`query_human` and related helpers for human perception. The interface is initialised lazily through the
`init_robokudo_interface` decorator, which establishes the action client on first use.

## Blum kitchen API

{mod}`coraplex.external_interfaces.blum_api` is the interface to a Blum smart-kitchen service. It authenticates against
the service and issues commands to motorised kitchen furniture, for example `open_cabinet` and `close_cabinet`, and
reads the current `kitchen_state`. As with RoboKudo, the connection is set up through the
`init_kitchen_interface` decorator.
