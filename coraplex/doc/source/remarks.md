# General Remarks

## Jupyter Notebooks & PyCharm

If you have the situation that you activate your venv that has rospy installed and launched
PyCharm from the console you'll run into trouble using jupyter notebooks. PyCharm allows you
to correctly set up the jupyter server, however the notebook will always use your
`/usr/bin/python` as interpreter and you can't select the correct one in the drop down menu.

To fix this issue one has to execute

```shell
python -m ipykernel install --user --name <kernel_name> --display-name "<Name_to_display>"
```

, eg.

```shell
python -m ipykernel install --user --name coraplex --display-name "coraplex"
```

in your terminal. --name is the name of your virtual environment and --display-name is the name
that will display in the drop down menu of jupyter. After that, select the correct Python interpreter kernel (`coraplex`) and
everything should work now.
