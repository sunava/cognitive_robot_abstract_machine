Tests for the REAL/SIMULATED branch of ``GiskardExecutable.motion_state_chart`` (see
``coraplex/src/coraplex/plans/executables.py``).

On the real robot, tasks are wrapped in a single ``Sequence`` + ``EndMotion``; in
simulation, tasks are added individually and get pause/interrupt monitors and pre-/post-
condition monitors wired in.
