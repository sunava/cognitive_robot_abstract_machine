"""
The Stretch apartment demonstration against a controller running in its own process.

Every layer the demonstration stands on is verified in isolation elsewhere: the
controller configuration and actuation in ``test/giskardpy_test/test_ros2_stuff``, the
world fetch and synchronization in ``test/semantic_digital_twin_test/test_ros``, and the
motion mappings and action plans in ``test/coraplex_test``. This test is the only one
that runs them together with the controller in its own process, sharing no interpreter
state -- and the only one that notices when the demonstration's own spatial parameters
stop being feasible.
