"""
Unit tests for the stretches a live recording is divided into.

A recording carries no action list — only what each tick captured — so the segments its
replay timeline is marked from have to be read back out of the poses and the reported
actions. What is covered here is that reading: which objects count as carried, where
their carry windows begin and end, and which action names the stretch around them.
