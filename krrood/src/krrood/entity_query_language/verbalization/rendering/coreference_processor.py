"""
CoreferenceProcessor — the **one** place the discourse (coreference) decision is made.

A referring expression is named differently each time it appears: an indefinite first mention
(*"a Robot"*), a definite subsequent mention (*"the Robot"*), or a pronoun (*"its …"*) when it is
the current discourse subject.  Rules emit the *first-mention* form — a
:class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.verbalization.fragments.base.NounPhrase` tagged with a
``referent_id`` (and construction definiteness + label + modifiers), wrapped where appropriate in a
:class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.verbalization.fragments.base.SubjectScope`.  This pass walks
the finished tree in **document order**, tracking which referents have been introduced and which is
the current subject, and **downgrades** every repeat mention to a definite reference (dropping the
first-mention modifiers, keeping the head label) or a pronoun.

It runs *first* in the realisation pipeline (before the determiner phase), so by the time
``DeterminerProcessor`` runs every NP carries a resolved definiteness and no ``referent_id`` matters
any more, and every ``SubjectScope`` has been replaced by its child.
