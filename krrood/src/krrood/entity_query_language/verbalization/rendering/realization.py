"""
Realisation pipeline — the **one** place the lowering passes and their order are defined.

Both the whole-expression build and the local realisation of an opaque
:class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.predicate.Verbalizable` template need the same
ordered sequence of passes (lower the DP, then apply morphology).  Defining it once here —
rather than re-spelling ``DeterminerProcessor`` → ``MorphologyProcessor`` at each call site —
means the ordering lives in a single location, and a future pass (e.g. a coreference
resolution stage) is inserted in exactly one spot.

Reference: Gatt & Reiter (2009), SimpleNLG — the ordered realisation stages.
