"""
Referring-expression generation — choosing how to *name* an entity each time it
is mentioned.

This is the **referring-expression generation** subtask of microplanning
(Reiter & Dale 2000): deciding between an indefinite first mention (*"a Robot"*),
a definite subsequent mention (*"the Robot"*), a numbered form when one type
occurs several times (*"Robot 1"* / *"Robot 2"*), and a pronoun (*"its …"*) when a
chain is rooted at the current discourse subject.  All of these facets share one
piece of state — what has been mentioned so far — and change for one reason
(referring-expression policy), so they form a single cohesive responsibility.
