"""
The grammar as first-class rule objects — a :class:`PhraseRule` subclass per EQL
construct, the dispatch primitive :func:`select`, and the per-node :class:`Ctx`
handed to a rule.

This realises the **rule-to-rule** mapping of Montague grammar: each construct of
the source algebra (an EQL :class:`~krrood.entity_query_language.core.base_expressions.SymbolicExpression`)
has one rule describing how it composes into the target (English) algebra.  Rules
are registered as *instances* (the ``RULES`` list in
:mod:`~krrood.entity_query_language.verbalization.grammar.english`), so the grammar
is still queryable with EQL (``entity(r).where(r.construct == Comparator)``) while a
rule's behaviour lives in an overridable :meth:`PhraseRule.build` method — the
natural home for the planner/assembler split of the more complex constructs.

Specificity is driven by the ``construct`` class attribute (not by the rule-class
hierarchy), so rules stay flat and dispatch is honest.
